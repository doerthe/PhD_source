\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter we investigated which impact the fact that we have different interpretations for implicit universal quantification on 
reasoning files used for practical applications.

In order to do so, we implemented the attribute grammar defined in the previous chapter. 
This implementations allows us to produce the concrete \nthree Core Logic equivalent of an \nthree formula following the different interpretations and 
used for testing: Whoever wants to provide \nthree rules in the Web, can test whether the rules he or she created are subject to ambiguity.  

We applied our implementation on different on the example use cases of EYE and on different sets of files which have been implemented in research projects 
to solve practical problems. We encountered that 31\% of our files were subject to contradictions. 
We further investigated the contexts in which we could observe these contradictions and
