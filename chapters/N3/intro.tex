% In Section~\ref{n3examples}  we already briefly introduced \nthreelogic by discussing several examples and their intended meaning. We furthermore explained 
% that this \emph{intended meaning} 
% is problematic:
The semantics of \nthreelogic is only defined in an informal way by the \wwwc team submission~\cite{Notation3} and a journal paper~\cite{N3Logic}. 
This leaves room for interpretation and it actually leads to contradicting implementations. 
In this chapter, we take a closer look at this problem and its possible solutions. % and the related \hyperlink{rq2}{Research Question 2}.
%We first briefly discuss the semantics of \rdf, the logic \nthree extends, and have a look at possible challenges
%In order to answer  and test \hyperlink{h2}{Hypothesis 2} we create several test cases .  
We first collect evidence %for this problem 
by giving concrete example formulas which, when given to the reasoners Cwm~\cite{cwm} and EYE~\cite{eye}, lead to different results. 
The discrepancies we encounter are mainly related to 
implicit quantification: \nthree allows the use of quantified variables whose universal or existential quantifier is not explicitly stated but implicitly assumed.
% Having understood this difficulty To understand how such a concept can be formalised, we discuss other frameworks which support implicit quantification and their semantics. Here we especially 
% focus on \rdf, the logic which is extended by \nthree: blank node in \rdf are understood as implicitly existentially quantified.
The problem can be solved by providing a formalisation which clearly indicates how implicit quantification needs to be interpreted. To better understand how such a formalisation 
could look like we discuss different logics supporting some kind of implicit quantification, in particular \rdf and other formats related to the Semantic Web, and discuss
in which aspects they differ 
from \nthree.

% We encounter similar concepts in other logics and especially in 
% %Similar concepts can be found in other logics, in particular in 
% \rdf where blank nodes are understood as implicitly existentially quantified. 
% % To better understand how implicit quantification can be handled in a formal model a closer look to \rdf semantics and the conclude this section
% % by discussing implicit quantification in general.
% In order to find a way to formally describe the semantics of \nthree we take a closer look to \rdf{}'s semantics and implicit quantification 
% 


% To put our observations into context, we then discuss how the concept of implicit quantification is handled in related contexts. In particular we give an overview of 
% \rdf semantics and 
% To formalise the difference in the interpretations of implicit quantification, we define a core logic for \nthree which is very close to the original 
% but only allows explicit quantification. 
% One part of such implicitly quantified variables are also present in the logic \nthree is based on: \rdf understands blank nodes as existentially quantified variables.
% To better understand how the semantics of a language can deal with implicit quantification we next take a look into \rdf semantics
