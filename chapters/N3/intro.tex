In Section~\ref{n3examples} we already briefly introduced \nthreelogic by discussing several examples and their intended meaning. We furthermore explained 
that this \emph{intended meaning} 
is problematic: The semantics of \nthreelogic is only defined in an informal way by the \wwwc team submission~\cite{Notation3} and a journal paper~\cite{N3Logic}. 
This leaves room for interpretation and it actually leads to contradicting implementations. In this chapter, we take a closer look to this problem.  
We first collect evidence for this problem by showing how the reasoner Cwm and EYE can be tested.
