\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter we introduced \nthree Core Logic a core logic for \nthree.  \nthree Core Logic contains all important features of 
\nthree{} -- like for example a construct to cite formulas~-- but only supports explicit quantification. 
We provided a clear model theory for the logic and discussed its relation to \rdf: \nthree Core Logic is syntactically and semantically compatible  with \rdf.

We furthermore defined an attribute grammar
to map from \nthree syntax to \nthree Core Logic following the interpretations assumed by the reasoners Cwm and EYE. 
By that, we defined the semantics of \nthree in two possible ways and made it possible to compare the interpretations of single formulas.
Our formalism facilitates the discussion of different possibilities to understand \nthree and thereby contributes to finding a common agreement.

Having identified the differences in the different implementations of \nthree reasoners and formalised them, we are now interested in the practical consequences of these 
differences. Can we observe contradicting interpretations for files used in practical applications or is the problem we found of rather theoretical 
nature? This is the question we are going to answer in the following chapter.
