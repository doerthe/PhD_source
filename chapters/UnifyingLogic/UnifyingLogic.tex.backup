\chapter{A unifying logic for the Semantic Web}
\section{The vision of the Semantic Web}
My idea for this chapter is to explain a little bit more about the semantic web in general and its architecture


\section{Architecture}

Gerber \cite{Gerber} \cite{Gerber2}. Really nicht: abstracts from technnologies. Bad: the word ``unifying Logic'' dissapeared.

\cite{rearch} Paper by Boley, Kifer, etc. ``realistic'' architecture, not just one technology.

\subsection{Unifying Logic}
What do we expect from the ``unifying logic''?

The vision of the Semantic Web is to enable machines to use the Web just as humans do. For that they need to be able to \emph{understand} and \emph{exchange} data through the Web. 
An unambiguous way to express knowledge is needed, a logic. 
This logic needs to be well defined to avoid misunderstandings and it needs to be agreed on this definition between all possible parties involved.




% The Unifying Logic needs to be well-defined in itself, it needs to be able to ``understand'' the underlying formats, in particular to query, do DL reasoning and use rules. 
% Additionally it should provide the opportunity to connect to the proof layer.
Requirements:
\begin{description}
 \item[clear semantic definition] 
The meaning of every statement needs to be clearly defined.
 \item[compatibility with existing Web standards]  Existing standards of the Semantic Web need to be supported. 
 In particular, querying, Description Logics, and rule based reasoning need to be covered.
 \item[support of proofs] It must be possible to express, interchange and check all derivations made in the logic.
 \item[capability to handle change] It must be possible to express and reason about change.
\end{description}
\subsection{Proofs}
\section{Research questions}
Question: Is N3 a suitable candidate to become the unifying logic for the semantic web?

Sub-questions:

Can we give a clear semantic definition of Notation3 Logic?

How does Notation3 Logic interfere with other formats? Can SPARQL, OWL and RIF be expressed?

Is it possible to express proofs in N3?

Can N3 handle change?

I think I need to be more specific. To find that: what do I actually do here?

\textbf{Part 1:}
I try to find out what the semantics of N3 is. 

I find one specific problem which is not easy to solve: implicit quantification. Here I need to discuss the problem: meaning not clear.

Next: who understands it how? Different ``official'' sources, tests on reasoners.


Then: we know the differences, can we fomalize those?

To do so, we go for attribute grammars, implemet a tool, test the impact of the problem.

We argue that we are in favor of doing as EYE does, but for the rest of the thesis we assume the semantics as in the team submission. Foollowing that, we also give a direct semantic which we want 
to use in the following chapters.

Question: should I display both, direct and elaboration Semantics? Alternative: only go for elaboration, but then the proofs in the RESTdesc part need to be adjusted.

\textbf{Part2:}








Somewhere I need to talk about problems, especially decidability and for example the problems of OWL full.
