%Describe the ``culture shock'' and explain why you chose the quote above. 



Taking up the quote from above, I thank everyone who tried nevertheless.
I particular I thank Miel for guiding me through the writing process of this thesis. Femke for listening and helping with all kinds of problems. 
Joachim for always having answers.
I furthermore thank all former members of the Knowledge on Web-Scale (KNoWS) team -- especially Tom D.N., Sam, Hajar, Cristian, Laurens, Gayane, Dieter D.P., Dieter D.W. --
and all its current members, in particular:
Pieter C.,
Pieter H.,
Ben, Sven, Gerald, Martin, Julian, Harm, Brecht, Anastasia, and Ruben T.  
I also thank  all current and former members of IBCN I had the pleasure to work with, in particular Pieter B., Mathias, Stijn and Alexander.
%Miel, Jos, Ruben, Tom, Pieter Pauwels, Femke, Agfa etc.

Furthermore, I thank all people at Agfa I collaborated with. I always enjoyed visiting you. In particular I thank Giovanni for always sharing the programmer's perspective with me,
I thank Hong  for his challenging questions, Boris for helping me with decisions, and Els for always trying to keep us focussed -- I know that this is not an easy 
task given that Jos and I really enjoy discussing logical details. 
A very special thanks goes to Jos for exactly those discussions. I think there is no one with whom talking about logics is more enjoyable.
It was you who reminded me how exciting research is.

I thank all members of my jury for agreeing to review my thesis. Here, I would like to thank Harold in particular for making me feel welcome in the RuleML community.
 
A special thank you also goes to my supervisors.
I thank Tom S. for encouraging me to aim for \emph{good} papers instead of papers \emph{good enough to be accepted}.
I thank Erik for always backing me up. I thank Ruben for sharing his enthusiasm with me and for pointing me to my research topic:
I am very happy that you immediately anticipated my passion for \nthreelogic.  

I also thank all my friends who supported me during the writing of my thesis or even before. 
A special thanks goes to Stefanie, my former colleague, who encouraged me to start this journey, without her I would never have applied for my PhD position.
I thank my family, my parents, my two brothers and, especially, my sister Sabine who helped me with the Dutch translation of my summary.

Last, but not least, I thank Nicolas who gave me a lot practical and moral support especially in the last weeks of writing where he took care of our daughter Paula. 
Without you this thesis would not have been possible.
Thank you!
