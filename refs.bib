abstract = "Today's construction industry relies heavily on high-performing building information modelling (BIM) systems. By deploying the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications are able to infer extra information. For a certain functionality, IFC shows limitations however. Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking."

abstract = "There is a growing need to semantically process and integrate clinical data from different sources for clinical research. This paper presents an approach to integrate EHRs from heterogeneous resources and generate integrated data in different data formats or semantics to support various clinical research applications. The proposed approach builds semantic data virtualization layers on top of data sources, which generate data in the requested semantics or formats on demand. This approach avoids upfront dumping to and synchronizing of the data with various representations. Data from different EHR systems are first mapped to RDF data with source semantics, and then converted to representations with harmonized domain semantics where domain ontologies and terminologies are used to improve reusability. It is also possible to further convert data to application semantics and store the converted results in clinical research databases, e.g. i2b2, OMOP, to support different clinical research settings. Semantic conversions between different representations are explicitly expressed using N3 rules and executed by an N3 Reasoner (EYE), which can also generate proofs of the conversion processes. The solution presented in this paper has been applied to real-world applications that process large scale EHR data."

abstract="``Meaning'' may be assigned to a string in a context-free language by defining ``attributes'' of the symbols in a derivation tree for that string. The attributes can be defined by functions associated with each production in the grammar. This paper examines the implications of this process when some of the attributes are ``synthesized'', i.e., defined solely in terms of attributes of thedescendants of the corresponding nonterminal symbol, while other attributes are ``inherited'', i.e., defined in terms of attributes of theancestors of the nonterminal symbol. An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature.",

abstract="An important open question in the semantic Web is the precise relationship between the RDF(S) semantics and the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as logic programming and description logics. In this paper we address this issue by considering embeddings of RDF and RDFS in logic. Using these embeddings, combined with existing results about various fragments of logic, we establish several novel complexity results. The embeddings we consider show how techniques from deductive databases and description logics can be used for reasoning with RDF(S). Finally, we consider querying RDF graphs and establish the data complexity of conjunctive querying for the various RDF entailment regimes.",

abstract="A layered architecture for the Semantic Web that adheres to software engineering principles and the fundamental aspects of layered architectures will assist in the development of Semantic Web specifications and applications. The most well-known versions of the layered architecture that exist within literature have been proposed by Berners-Lee. It is possible to indicate inconsistencies and discrepancies in the different versions of the architecture, leading to confusion, as well as conflicting proposals and adoptions by the Semantic Web community. A more recent version of a Semantic Web layered architecture, namely the CFL architecture, was proposed in 2007 by Gerber, van der Merwe and Barnard [23], which adheres to software engineering principles and addresses several of the concerns evident from previous versions of the architecture. In this paper we evaluate this recent architecture, both by scrutinising the shortcomings of previous architectures and evaluating the approach used for the development of the latest architecture. Furthermore, the architecture is applied to usage scenarios to evaluate the usefulness thereof.",

In particular, we argue that there is a very important class of rule-based languages, with over thirty years of history and experience, which cannot be layered on top of OWL and must be included in the Semantic Web architecture alongside with the stack of OWL-based languages. The class of languages we are after includes rules in the Logic Programming style, which support default negation. We briefly survey the logical foundations of these languages and then discuss an interoperability framework in which such languages can co-exist with OWL and its extensions.",

abstract="Ontology-based data access (OBDA) is regarded as a key ingredient of the new generation of information systems. In the OBDA paradigm, an ontology defines a high-level global schema of (already existing) data sources and provides a vocabulary for user queries. An OBDA system rewrites such queries and ontologies into the vocabulary of the data sources and then delegates the actual query evaluation to a suitable query answering system such as a relational database management system or a datalog engine. In this chapter, we mainly focus on OBDA with the ontology language OWL 2QL, one of the three profiles of the W3C standard Web Ontology Language OWL 2, and relational databases, although other possible languages will also be discussed. We consider different types of conjunctive query rewriting and their succinctness, different architectures of OBDA systems, and give an overview of the OBDA system Ontop.",

abstract="The relationship between the Web Ontology Language OWL and rule-based formalisms has been the subject of many discussions and research investigations, some of them controversial. From the many attempts to reconcile the two paradigms, we present some of the newest developments. More precisely, we show which kind of rules can be modeled in the current version of OWL, and we show how OWL can be extended to incorporate rules. We finally give references to a large body of work on rules and OWL.",
