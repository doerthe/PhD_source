abstract = "Today's construction industry relies heavily on high-performing building information modelling (BIM) systems. By deploying the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications are able to infer extra information. For a certain functionality, IFC shows limitations however. Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking."

abstract = "There is a growing need to semantically process and integrate clinical data from different sources for clinical research. This paper presents an approach to integrate EHRs from heterogeneous resources and generate integrated data in different data formats or semantics to support various clinical research applications. The proposed approach builds semantic data virtualization layers on top of data sources, which generate data in the requested semantics or formats on demand. This approach avoids upfront dumping to and synchronizing of the data with various representations. Data from different EHR systems are first mapped to RDF data with source semantics, and then converted to representations with harmonized domain semantics where domain ontologies and terminologies are used to improve reusability. It is also possible to further convert data to application semantics and store the converted results in clinical research databases, e.g. i2b2, OMOP, to support different clinical research settings. Semantic conversions between different representations are explicitly expressed using N3 rules and executed by an N3 Reasoner (EYE), which can also generate proofs of the conversion processes. The solution presented in this paper has been applied to real-world applications that process large scale EHR data."

abstract="``Meaning'' may be assigned to a string in a context-free language by defining ``attributes'' of the symbols in a derivation tree for that string. The attributes can be defined by functions associated with each production in the grammar. This paper examines the implications of this process when some of the attributes are ``synthesized'', i.e., defined solely in terms of attributes of thedescendants of the corresponding nonterminal symbol, while other attributes are ``inherited'', i.e., defined in terms of attributes of theancestors of the nonterminal symbol. An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature.",

abstract="An important open question in the semantic Web is the precise relationship between the RDF(S) semantics and the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as logic programming and description logics. In this paper we address this issue by considering embeddings of RDF and RDFS in logic. Using these embeddings, combined with existing results about various fragments of logic, we establish several novel complexity results. The embeddings we consider show how techniques from deductive databases and description logics can be used for reasoning with RDF(S). Finally, we consider querying RDF graphs and establish the data complexity of conjunctive querying for the various RDF entailment regimes.",

abstract="A layered architecture for the Semantic Web that adheres to software engineering principles and the fundamental aspects of layered architectures will assist in the development of Semantic Web specifications and applications. The most well-known versions of the layered architecture that exist within literature have been proposed by Berners-Lee. It is possible to indicate inconsistencies and discrepancies in the different versions of the architecture, leading to confusion, as well as conflicting proposals and adoptions by the Semantic Web community. A more recent version of a Semantic Web layered architecture, namely the CFL architecture, was proposed in 2007 by Gerber, van der Merwe and Barnard [23], which adheres to software engineering principles and addresses several of the concerns evident from previous versions of the architecture. In this paper we evaluate this recent architecture, both by scrutinising the shortcomings of previous architectures and evaluating the approach used for the development of the latest architecture. Furthermore, the architecture is applied to usage scenarios to evaluate the usefulness thereof.",

In particular, we argue that there is a very important class of rule-based languages, with over thirty years of history and experience, which cannot be layered on top of OWL and must be included in the Semantic Web architecture alongside with the stack of OWL-based languages. The class of languages we are after includes rules in the Logic Programming style, which support default negation. We briefly survey the logical foundations of these languages and then discuss an interoperability framework in which such languages can co-exist with OWL and its extensions.",

abstract="Ontology-based data access (OBDA) is regarded as a key ingredient of the new generation of information systems. In the OBDA paradigm, an ontology defines a high-level global schema of (already existing) data sources and provides a vocabulary for user queries. An OBDA system rewrites such queries and ontologies into the vocabulary of the data sources and then delegates the actual query evaluation to a suitable query answering system such as a relational database management system or a datalog engine. In this chapter, we mainly focus on OBDA with the ontology language OWL 2QL, one of the three profiles of the W3C standard Web Ontology Language OWL 2, and relational databases, although other possible languages will also be discussed. We consider different types of conjunctive query rewriting and their succinctness, different architectures of OBDA systems, and give an overview of the OBDA system Ontop.",

abstract="The traditional semantics for relational logic (sometimes called Tarskian semantics) is based on the notion of interpretations of constants
in terms of objects external to the logic. Herbrand semantics is an alternative that is based on truth assignments for ground sentences without reference 
to external objects. Herbrand semantics is simpler and more intuitive than Tarskian semantics; and, consequently, it is easier to teach and learn.
Moreover, it is stronger than Tarskian semantics. For example, while it is not possible to finitely axiomatize integer arithmetic with Tarskian semantics, 
this can be done easily with Herbrand semantics. The downside is a loss of some common logical properties, such as compactness and inferential completeness. 
However, there is no loss of inferential power---anything that can be deduced according to Tarskian semantics can also be deduced according to Herbrand semantics. 
Based on these results, we argue that there is value in using Herbrand semantics for relational logic in place of Tarskian semantics. 
It alleviates many of the current problems with relational logic and ultimately may foster a wider use of relational logic in human reasoning and computer applications.",

In this article, we present the results of a systematic review of approaches for assessing the quality of LD. We gather existing approaches and analyze them qualitatively. In particular, we unify and formalize commonly used terminologies across papers related to data quality and provide a comprehensive list of 18 quality dimensions and 69 metrics. Additionally, we qualitatively analyze the 30 core approaches and 12 tools using a set of attributes. The aim of this article is to provide researchers and data curators a comprehensive understanding of existing work, thereby encouraging further experimentation and development of new approaches focused towards data quality, specifically for LD.},

  abstract     = {Ontology engineering methodologies tend to emphasize the role of the knowledge engineer or require a very active role of domain experts. In this paper, a participatory ontology engineering method is described that holds the middle ground between these two 'extremes'. After thorough ethnographic research, an interdisciplinary group of domain experts closely interacted with ontology engineers and social scientists in a series of workshops. Once a preliminary ontology was developed, a dynamic care request system was built using the ontology. Additional workshops were organized involving a broader group of domain experts to ensure the applicability of the ontology across continuous care settings. The proposed method successfully actively engaged domain experts in constructing the ontology, without overburdening them. Its applicability is illustrated by presenting the co-created continuous care ontology. The lessons learned during the design and execution of the approach are also presented.},

abstract="Finding the justifications of an entailment (that is, all the minimal set of axioms sufficient to produce an entailment) has emerged as a key inference service for the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Justifications are essential for debugging unsatisfiable classes and contradictions. The availability of justifications as explanations of entailments improves the understandability of large and complex ontologies. In this paper, we present several algorithms for computing all the justifications of an entailment in an OWL-DL Ontology and show, by an empirical evaluation, that even a reasoner independent approach works well on real ontologies.",

abstract="Finding the justifications for an entailment (i.e., minimal sets of axioms responsible for it) is a prominent reasoning service in ontology engineering, as justifications facilitate important tasks like debugging inconsistencies or undesired subsumption. Though several algorithms for finding all justifications exist, issues concerning efficiency and scalability remain a challenge due to the sheer size of real-life ontologies. In this paper, we propose a novel method for finding all justifications in OWL DL ontologies by limiting the search space to smaller modules. To this end, we show that so-called locality-based modules cover all axioms in the justifications. We present empirical results that demonstrate an improvement of several orders of magnitude in efficiency and scalability of finding all justifications in OWL DL ontologies.",

abstract="In ontology-based data access (OBDA), access to (multiple) incomplete data sources is mediated by a conceptual layer constituted by an ontology. In such a setting, to correctly compute answers to queries, it is necessary to perform complex reasoning over the constraints expressed by the ontology. We consider the case of ontologies expressed in DL{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}Lite, a family of DLs that, in the context of OBDA, provide an optimal tradeoff between expressive power and computational complexity of reasoning; notably conjunctive query answering is LOGSPACE in the size of the data. However, query answering with reasoning comes at a price: the justification of the presence of tuples in answers is no longer trivial, and requires explanation. In this paper, we characterize reasoning in DL{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}Lite, through deduction rules for building proofs, and we provide several novel contributions: (i) For standard ontology level reasoning, explanation is relatively simple, and our contribution comes mainly from a novel focus on brevity of proofs. (ii) Motivated by the use of DL{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}Lite for OBDA, we analyze and provide explanation for reasoning in finite models. (iii) We provide a facility for the explanation of an answer to a conjunctive query over a DL{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}Lite ontology. This algorithm is able to exploit the relational query engine to extract from the data the information necessary for finding the explanation more efficiently, and thus scales to large data sets. The presented approach has been implemented in a prototype for constructing explanations.",

In essence, justifications are merely the premises of a proof and, as such, do not articulate the (often non-obvious) reasoning which connect those premises with the conclusion.
