  Abstract                 = {The energy of a many-electron quantum system can be approximated by a constrained optimization of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that is solvable in polynomial time by semidefinite programming (SDP). Here we develop a SDP method for computing strongly correlated 2-RDMs that is 10–20 times faster than previous methods [D. A. Mazziotti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 213001 (2004)]. We illustrate with (i) the dissociation of N2 and (ii) the metal-to-insulator transition of H50. For H50 the SDP problem has 9.4×106 variables. This advance also expands the feasibility of large-scale applications in quantum information, control, statistics, and economics.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this graduate-level textbook is to present and explain, at other than a superficial level, modem ab initio approaches to the calculation of the electronic structure and properties of molecules. The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},
